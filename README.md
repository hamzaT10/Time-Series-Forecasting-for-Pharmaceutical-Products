# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Pharmaceutical-Products
# Project Overview
The Time Series Forecasting for Pharmaceutical Products project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate future demand for pharmaceutical products. The primary goal is to enhance inventory management, optimize production levels, and reduce costs associated with stockouts or overstocking.

# Objectives
Demand Prediction: Utilize time series forecasting techniques to predict future demand for pharmaceutical products.
Inventory Optimization: Help maintain optimal inventory levels to avoid shortages or surpluses.
Cost Reduction: Minimize costs related to inventory management and production by providing accurate forecasts.
# Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main language for model development and data analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization and plotting.
- **Statsmodels**: Applied for statistical modeling and time series analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training deep learning models.
# Approach
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on pharmaceutical product sales, including relevant features such as seasonal trends, promotional events, and market conditions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that may impact demand.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM, and Prophet, to identify the most suitable approach.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train the selected models using historical data, evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and select the best-performing model.
- **Forecast Generation**: Use the trained model to generate forecasts for future demand, and visualize the results to facilitate decision-making.
# Results
The forecasting model provides accurate predictions of future demand, enabling better inventory management and production planning. The results help reduce costs associated with stock management and ensure that products are available when needed.
# Conclusion
The Time Series Forecasting for Pharmaceutical Products project leverages advanced time series forecasting techniques to improve inventory management and production efficiency. By providing accurate demand predictions, the project helps optimize stock levels, reduce costs, and enhance overall operational effectiveness in the pharmaceutical industry.
